                    <p>In his first season in Formula 1 he finished second in the championship. That year Fangio won the Grand Prix of Monaco, Belgium and France. Throughout the season he drove an Alfa Romeo 158.</p>

                    <p>Fangio signed for Maserati, and hoped to retain the crown. A terrible accident in a race at Monza before the season produced a fracture in his neck, which sidelined him from the track for the whole season while he recovered.</p>

                    <p>Fangio returns to Formula 1 with a Maserati A6GCM-53, but it was not until the Dutch Grand Prix, when the Maserati A6SSG was introduced, that Fangio began to make progress. Fangio wins the last race of the season in Monza, Italy. This secured him second place in the championship.</p>

                    <p>Fangio signs with Mercedes, but the car was not presented in the first two races, and he raced with Maserati, winning both. By the third race, in France, the Mercedes was ready. Fangio started from pole position and won. He won the Grand Prix of Argentina, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, winning his second F1 title.</p>

                    <p>Fangio with Mercedes W196 R wins his third championship with four victories, one second place and one retirement. The victories were in Argentina, Belgium, Holland and Italy. He retired in Monaco and finished second in England.
                        The season was overshadowed by the death of his friend and most difficult rival, according to Fangio's words, Alberto Ascari.

                    <h2>1958</h2>
                    <p>It was the last year Fangio raced, only competing in Argentina and France, where he finished fourth on both occasions. In his last race, in France, his Maserati was struggling to finish when the race leader, Mike Hawthorn, got behind him. 
                        Hawthorn slowed down and allowed Fangio to cross the line in front of him and not take him a lap down as the race ended, and is perhaps a clear sign of the high respect the other racers had for Fangio. All his contemporaries recognized him as 'the master'.
